#!/usr/bin/env node
// tools/build-index.mjs
//
// Two generated-content jobs, both driven by titleZh / zh-* content that
// already exists in the source:
//
//  1. Rewrites data/songs.json with three generated fields for every record
//     that has titleZh: titleZhAlt (opposite script), pinyin, and
//     pinyinInitials. Per BILINGUAL-SPEC.md §7/§9.
//  2. Writes a py: line beneath every zh-* lyric line in every v2
//     (data-format="bilingual") chart under charts/ — the generated-pinyin
//     reading-aid layer BILINGUAL-SPEC.md §5.6 defines, so team members who
//     read pinyin but not Han characters can follow along.
//
// ── How to run ──
//
//   npm install
//   node tools/build-index.mjs
//
// No flags. Always reads and rewrites data/songs.json in full, and rewrites
// (in place) any chart file whose py: lines are missing or out of date.
//
// ── DO NOT HAND-EDIT titleZhAlt, pinyin, pinyinInitials, or any py: line ──
//
// All of these are always recomputed and overwritten on every run — that's
// what makes this idempotent (same input -> same output) and it's also the
// enforcement mechanism for the rule: a hand-edit to any of them is
// silently clobbered the next time this script runs. If a generated value
// looks wrong:
//   - Wrong titleZhAlt/pinyin/pinyinInitials -> fix titleZh, re-run.
//   - Wrong py: reading -> add/fix an entry in tools/pinyin-exceptions.json
//     (character or whole phrase -> correct reading), re-run. Don't patch
//     the chart file by hand — see BILINGUAL-SPEC.md §5.6's own framing of
//     this ("fix it in the build script's exception map, not the chart").
// See also the data/songs.json section of CLAUDE.md.
//
// tools/pinyin-exceptions.json is loaded once at startup via pinyin-pro's
// own customPinyin() (character *and* phrase-level overrides, in one flat
// map — pinyin-pro does the longest-match itself) and applies globally, so
// it also corrects any songs.json titleZh pinyin that happens to contain
// one of the same characters — one exception map, both generators.
// Starter entries: 祢 (the reverential "You" used for God in worship
// lyrics) defaults to the surname reading "mí" in pinyin-pro's own
// dictionary — a real, confirmed miss, not a hypothetical; 的/了/得 default
// to their least-common-in-lyrics polyphonic readings ("dí/liǎo/dé")
// rather than the overwhelmingly common sung-Mandarin ones. These are
// starter corrections, not an exhaustive table — grow the file as real
// readings turn up wrong.
//
// Known limitation: py: generation assumes the zh-* line's text (after
// stripping [chord] brackets) has no literal whitespace — pinyin-pro emits
// exactly one space-separated token per input character *including*
// punctuation, which is what lets the renderer zip pinyin syllables
// 1:1 against Han characters for ruby annotation, but a literal space
// inside the lyric text would collapse against the token separators and
// break that count. Not a real concern for this corpus (Chinese lyric text
// doesn't use inter-word spacing) but worth knowing if it ever changes.
//
// Records without titleZh, and chart files that aren't data-format
// "bilingual", are left completely untouched.
//
// ── Script detection: opencc-js's own tables, not a hand list ──
//
// titleZh is converted through opencc-js in both directions (cn->tw and
// tw->cn). Whichever direction actually changes the string tells you which
// script titleZh is already in; the other direction's output becomes
// titleZhAlt. If neither direction changes it (every character is shared
// between scripts), titleZhAlt is set equal to titleZh and it's noted on
// stdout — an honest fallback, and harmless for search: an identical
// "alternate" still matches trivially.
//
// This only classifies titleZh itself, independent of the langs field
// (which tools/docx-to-chart.mjs sets from the chart *body*'s dominant
// script — a different, wider piece of text). The two can legitimately
// disagree on a song where the title was typed in one script out of habit
// but the body was transcribed in the other; this script doesn't try to
// reconcile that, since it only ever touches title-derived fields.
//
// ── Whole-file rewrite ──
//
// This does a full parse + JSON.stringify(data, null, 2), not a surgical
// per-record patch, so it also normalizes this file's inconsistent legacy
// spacing (some records use "ccli": "x", others "ccli":"x" — years of
// hand-editing). That's a deliberate one-time cost the first time this runs;
// every run after stays clean since the file is already normalized.
